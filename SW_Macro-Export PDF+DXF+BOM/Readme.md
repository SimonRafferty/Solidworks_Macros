Given an assembly of sheet metal (and other) parts, this will optionally export all the 2D Drawings as PDF's
and export flat patterns of any sheet metal parts within the assembly.
It will also create a BoM (as a CSV File) for the sheet metal parts in a format friendly to Laser Cutting & folding shops.

The Flat Patterns are exported with a file name such as 6mm (Mild Steel) 23 Off - Widget.dxf
Based on the material and material thickness from the model.  This format is also friendly to laser cutting shops who cannot figure out how to open the BoM.
