This is probably my favorite Macro!

Boss: "How much steel do I need to order? I need to know in the next 5 mins!"
Me, 10 seconds later "you'll need 147 7.5m lengths of 100x100x6........"

That was where this macro started - the lead times on bulk steel were long at the time and my boss wanted to pre-order all the steel a few hours into the project.  I had a basic layout for the weldment - but it was difficult to give an estimate to the accuracy required.  He'd be mad if I was under or over - and forget that he'd not given me time to design it, never mind calculate the amount of steel.

To work out how many lengths you need, you need to work out how to optimally cut each length of steel into the bits required for the weldment.  This is a complex problem, so my solution is not optimal but accurate enough.

In the process of working it out, it also generates an optimised cut list, telling the workshop what order to cut which bits from each length of steel.  I thought they would hate it, the computer telling them what to do - but in fact they love it.  Follow the instructions and you know you'll have enough steel to finish the job (rather than discovering at the end you have 50 short lengths left over - but need one long length!)

The estimate of what lengths of what material are displayed as a pop-up message while the optimised cut list is exported to a text file which you can copy & paste into a drawing - or just email to the foreman.

This has done more for my reputation than anything I've drawn!  Being able to give fast, accurate estimates and complete projects without having to wait for more steel to arrive.
