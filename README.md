# Solidworks_Macros
A collection of useful macros I've written, which will run on Solidworks CAD.

Although I've written dozens of macros for odd thisngs - these are my go-to's that I use all the time.  I hope you find them similarly useful.

There's a short description of how to use each, or what it does in each of the folders.

Feel free to distribute, modify etc, as you see fit.
