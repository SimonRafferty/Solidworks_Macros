Do you use Tab & Slot construction for welded sheet metal parts?
If so, you might like this!

If the parts are being laser cut, the laser rarely cuts a perfect internal 90 degree corner - there's usually a bit of dross in the corner that needs to be filed or ground out.
The solution is usually to add a small circle around each corner, relieving it - these are known as 'mouse ears'.

I've set up a keyboard shortcut so I click on a vertex, press the 'm' key and a dimensioned 2mm circle is drawn around that point.  It's MUCH quicker than drawing them all manually.
On thick material, you might want to increase the diameter of the mouse-ear a little - but I've found 2mm works OK from 2mm to 16mm plate.  Even though 2mm is too small a feature to cut accurately in 16mm plate, it's enough to relieve the corner.
